Helping student for subject DEB 2223 - Basic Microcontroller (PIC)

# Introduction
Hi! I'm FlyingWhale, also known as Aiman Rafiqi — a student from Kolej Vokasional Lebuh Cator, currently pursuing a Diploma in Electronics Technology.

This repository was created to help my classmates better understand the codes and concepts that might appear in our upcoming final exam. The goal is to make learning easier, clearer, and more accessible — especially for those who want to revise efficiently or catch up on missed lessons.

# Why This Repo Was Created
This repository was created to help my classmates better understand the codes that will be used in the upcoming final exam!This repository was created to help my classmates better understand the codes and components involved in our course.
It's specifically aimed at preparing for the final exam, where we are expected to write or understand code involving LCDs, 7-segment displays, and counters.

By sharing this repo, I hope it can serve as a learning aid for those who want to review or catch up, and also as a reference for those who are still confused with how the code works.

# Feature
* Easy-to-read and beginner-friendly code
* Example of how to use a counter with both LCD and 7-segment display
* Helpful comments and clean formatting

# How to Use?
Just copy the code from this repository into your preferred IDE or development environment.
Upload it to your microcontroller and observe how the counter works with both LCD and 7-segment display
